# Atlantium GTM Strategy

## The Flywheel

```
Instagram (founder on camera) → iOS App Download → Frontier Feed → Events → Club ($49/mo) → Services (high-ticket)
```

**90-Day Goal**: 20 Club members ($980 MRR) + 1-2 services clients

## PILLAR 1: POSITIONING

### Target Segments

| Segment | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Aspiring Builders | Overwhelmed by AI news | Frontier Feed curates signal from noise |
| Early Founders | Isolated, lack network | Events + Club = community |
| Underrepresented Groups | Excluded from tech networks | PBC mission = intentional inclusion |
| Growing Startups | Need dev help, can't afford agencies | Services at accessible pricing |

### Platform Strategy
- **Primary**: iOS App (Frontier Feed, Events, Club)
- **Secondary**: Web (Services, Dashboard)

### Growth Model
- **PLG**: Free app drives awareness and habit formation
- **WOM**: Events create shareable moments and organic referrals
